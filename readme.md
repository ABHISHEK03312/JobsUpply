# JobsUpply
Your first step into the working world

Group project for CZ2006.

### Mission statement

The mission of this project is to create an application that would help job seekers be more well-equipped and relevant for the industry.

In the current scenario students and graduates are expected to have the required skills in order to perform well in their respective fields of work. Our web application JobsUpply is a job platform that goes one step further. It not only recommends jobs to the user but also helps them satisfy the job requirements by recommending the right courses for the user to cover the skills gap. Thus our application makes the end user more prepared for the real world and makes their job search more efficient.
